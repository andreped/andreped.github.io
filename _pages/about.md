Hi! I am a PhD Candidate at the [AICAN](https://www.ntnu.edu/ikom/aican#/view/about) research group
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am also a part-time Research Scientist at the 
[Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sintef.no/en/expertise/sintef-technology-and-society/medical-technology/)
research group at SINTEF. My current research interests include self and
weakly-supervised learning for breast cancer prognostication.

I was a MSc student at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT), from August 2014 to June 2019,
in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I completed
a summer internship at SINTEF Digital in 2018, which I ended up collaborating with on my master's
thesis. From January 2019, I worked part-time at SINTEF while finishing my MSc degree
(Sivilingeniør).

The [Master's thesis](https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/19673?locale-attribute=en) revolved around
developing a multi-potent computer-aided design for automatic cancer diagnostics. It was tested
on multiple use cases for breast and lung cancer, both for radiology (CT) and histopathology (WSI).
As a result, I started my PhD fellowship October 2019 in collaboration with the same group as for
my Master's thesis.

In parallel to my PhD work, I have developed open, standalone softwares for C++ and Python, mainly
using Qt/PySide (e.g., [FastPathology](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology) and
[Raidionics](https://raidionics.github.io/)). I have published open command line tools
(e.g. [livermask](https://github.com/andreped/livermask),
[torchstain](https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/torchstain)),
and published papers to high-impact scientific journals related to medical image analysis and
deep learning (on topics such as
[image classification](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.971873/full),
[semantic segmentation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fradi.2021.711514/full),
[image registration](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.15717),
[high-performance computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399433),
[semi-supervised learning](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266147),
and [natural language processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9669410)).

I have also written a [book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98950-7_21)
and acted as a reviewer for scientific journals, such as 
[Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis),
[Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/),
[Frontiers in Medicine](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine), and
[BMC Medical Imaging](https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com).
Lastly, I have (co-)supervised four Master's students working on both supervised/unsupervised semantic segmentation of
3D medical images (CT) and histopathological images (WSIs).
