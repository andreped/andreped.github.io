Hi! I am a PhD Candidate at the [AICAN](https://www.ntnu.edu/ikom/aican#/view/about) research group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am also a Research Scientist at the [Medical Technology](https://www.sintef.no/en/expertise/sintef-technology-and-society/medical-technology/) research group at SINTEF Digital part-time. My current research interests include self and weakly-supervised learning for breast cancer prognostication.

I was a MSc student at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT), from August 2014 to June 2019, in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I completed a summer internship at SINTEF Digital in 2018, which I ended up collaborating with on my master's thesis. From January 2019, I worked part-time at SINTEF while finishing my MSc degree (Sivilingeniør).

The [Master's thesis](https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/19673?locale-attribute=en) revolved around developing a multi-potent computer-aided design for automatic cancer diagnostics. It was tested on multiple use cases for breast and lung cancer, both for radiology (CT) and histopathology (WSI). As a result, I started my PhD fellowship October 2019 in collaboration with the same group as for my Master's thesis.

In parallel to my PhD work, i have developed open, standalone softwares for C++ and Python, mainly using Qt/PySide (e.g., [FastPathology](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology) and [GSI-RADS](https://github.com/SINTEFMedtek/GSI-RADS)). I have published open command line tools (e.g. [livermask](https://github.com/andreped/livermask), [fast-stain-normalization](https://github.com/andreped/fast-stain-normalization)) and published papers to high-impact scientific journals related to medical image analysis and deep learning (on topics such as [image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03455), [semantic segmentation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fradi.2021.711514/full), [high-performance computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399433), [semi-supervised learning](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266147), and [natural language processing](https://www.sintef.no/en/publications/publication/1953028/)). In addition, I have (co-)supervised three Master's students working on semantic segmentation from 3D medical images (CT).
