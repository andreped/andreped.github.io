Hi! I'm a Senior AI Engineer at DIPS AS. I have strong experience in using
artificial intelligence and image analysis techniques for various medical applications, aiming to
develop solutions that can assist clinicians in their daily practice. Currently, my main focus is on
using generative AI and large multimodal models to solve various problems in the industry.

I was a MSc student at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT), from August 2014 to June 2019,
in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I completed
a summer internship at SINTEF Digital in 2018, which I ended up collaborating with on my Master's
thesis. From January 2019, I worked part-time at SINTEF while finishing my degree.

I started my PhD fellowship October 2019 in collaboration with the same research group as for
my Master's thesis. I was a PhD Candidate until 2023, where I published several papers on 
computational pathology, while I also held a position as a Research Scientist at the Medical
Image Analysis group at SINTEF. I successfully defended my PhD November 2024.

In parallel to my PhD work, I have developed open, standalone software for C++ and Python, mainly
using Qt5/PySide6 (e.g., [FastPathology](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology) and
[Raidionics](https://raidionics.github.io/)). I have published open command line tools
(e.g., [livermask](https://github.com/andreped/livermask)), developed Python packages (e.g.,
[gradient-accumulator](https://pypi.org/project/gradient-accumulator/0.2.2/),
[torchstain](https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/torchstain)),
and published articles to high-impact scientific journals related to medical image analysis and
deep learning (on topics such as
[image classification](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.971873/full),
[semantic segmentation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fradi.2021.711514/full),
[image-to-image registration](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282110),
[high-performance computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399433),
[semi-supervised learning](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266147),
and [natural language processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9669410)).

I have also written a [book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98950-7_21)
and acted as a reviewer for scientific journals, such as 
[Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis),
[Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/),
[Frontiers in Medicine](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine),
[IJCARS](https://www.springer.com/journal/11548),
[QIMS](https://qims.amegroups.com/), and
[BMC Medical Imaging](https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com).
Lastly, I have (co-)supervised five Master's students working on using deep learning for
supervised/semi-supervised segmentation of 3D medical images (CT), multilabel
histopathology image classification, and bronchoscopy video navigation.
