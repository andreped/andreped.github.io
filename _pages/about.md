Hi! I am a PhD fellow at the [AICAN](https://aican.no/) research group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am also a part-time employee at the [Medical Technology research group](https://www.sintef.no/en/expertise/sintef-technology-and-society/medical-technology/) at SINTEF. My current research interests include self and weakly-supervised learning for breast cancer prognostication.

I was a MSc student at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT), from August 2014 to June 2019, in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I completed a summer internship at SINTEF Digital in 2018, which I ended up collaborating with on my master's thesis. From January 2019, I worked part-time at SINTEF while finishing my MSc degree.

The master's thesis revolved around developing a multi-potent computer-aided design for automatic cancer diagnostics. It was tested on multiple use cases for breast and lung cancer, both for radiology (CT) and histopathology (WSI). As a result, I started my PhD fellowship october 2019 in collaboration with the same people as for my master's thesis.

In parallel to my PhD work, i have developed open, standalone softwares for C++ and Python, mainly using Qt/PySide. I have also published a lot of papers to high-impact scientific journals, on various topics related to medical image analysis and deep learning.
