Hi! I am a PhD fellow at the [AICAN](https://aican.no/) research group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I am also a part-time employee at the [Medical Technology research group](https://www.sintef.no/en/expertise/sintef-technology-and-society/medical-technology/) at SINTEF. My current research interests include self and weakly-supervised learning for breast cancer prognostication.

I was a MSc student at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT), from August 2014 to June 2019, in applied physics and mathematics, specializing in machine learning and statistics. I completed a summer internship at SINTEF Digital in 2018, which I ended up collaborating with on my master's thesis. From January 2019, I worked part-time at SINTEF while finishing my MSc degree (Civil Engineer).

The [master's thesis](https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/19673?locale-attribute=en) revolved around developing a multi-potent computer-aided design for automatic cancer diagnostics. It was tested on multiple use cases for breast and lung cancer, both for radiology (CT) and histopathology (WSI). As a result, I started my PhD fellowship october 2019 in collaboration with the same group as for my master's thesis.

In parallel to my PhD work, i have developed open, standalone softwares for C++ and Python, mainly using Qt/PySide (e.g., [FastPathology](https://github.com/AICAN-Research/FAST-Pathology) and [GSI-RADS](https://github.com/SINTEFMedtek/GSI-RADS)). In addition I have published open command line tools (e.g. [livermask](https://github.com/andreped/livermask), [fast-stain-normalization](https://github.com/andreped/fast-stain-normalization)). I have also published papers to high-impact scientific journals, on various topics related to medical image analysis and deep learning. In addition, I have (co-)supervised three master students with focus on semantic segmentation of cancer from medical images (CT).
